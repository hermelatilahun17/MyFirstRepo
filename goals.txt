My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

This year, my primary academic focus is on achieving excellent marks in my studies and successfully gaining admission into the Software Engineering department.

In parallel with my academic pursuits, I'm committed to completing the ALX program and maximizing my attendance at "hub" sessions to deepen my learning and networking. 
I also plan to significantly polish my coding skills and build several new projects that I can proudly showcase in my portfolio.
