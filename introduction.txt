Brief Introduction About Myself 

I'm Hermela Tilahun, a 19-year-old university student currently attending AASTU. 
My academic path is firmly set on software engineering, and I aspire to specialize in Artificial Intelligence later in my career. Beyond my studies, 
I engage in kickboxing and have a keen interest in reading, especially fiction and psychology, driven by a deep fascination with the human brain. 
I also dedicate my time to volunteering and youth empowerment initiatives.
